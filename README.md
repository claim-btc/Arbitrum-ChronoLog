## 📖 Introduction

**Chrono Valley** reimagines the Web3 user experience. We believe blockchain tools shouldn't look like stock trading terminals. They should be warm, inviting, and fun.

By combining **Pixel Art aesthetics** with **SocialFi mechanics**, we created a DApp where users don't just "store data"—they "plant memories" and "water" (tip) each other's logs.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎮 Immersive RPG Experience
* **"Load Game" Login**: We replaced the boring "Connect Wallet" button with an RPG-style save file loader.
* **Dynamic Day/Night Cycle**: The interface automatically switches between a sunny farm (Day) and a starry night (Night) based on your local time.
* **Pixel-Perfect UI**: Custom `VT323` typography, wood-texture modals, and retro sound effects.

### 💧 SocialFi Economy ("Watering")
* **Native Tipping**: Users can click the **"🚿 Water"** button on any post to send **0.0001 ETH** directly to the author.
* **Value Social**: This turns likes into actual value, encouraging high-quality content creation on-chain.

### ⏳ Dual-Mode Storage
* **Diary Mode**: Instant on-chain logging for daily thoughts.
* **Time Capsule**: Users can lock their messages until a specific future date using our custom-built date picker.
